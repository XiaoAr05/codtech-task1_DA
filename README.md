Domain: Data Analytics 

Duration: 5th December 2024 to 5th January 2025

Overview of the Project (EDA): 

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset to uncover meaningful insights and patterns in the data during my internship in CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS. The analysis explores the characteristics of the dataset, identifies trends, and examines relationships between features. Various visualization techniques are applied to understand distributions, correlations, and outliers, providing a comprehensive understanding of the sales data.


Key Activities:

1. Data Loading and Inspection:
   - Imported and loaded the dataset using pandas.
   - Inspected the first few rows, shape, data types, summary statistics, and missing values.

2. Data Visualizations:
   - Distributions:
     - Created histograms to analyze the distributions of Total Sales and Units Sold.
   - Categorical Analysis:
     - Visualized the distribution of product counts using a count plot.
   - Time Series Analysis:
     - Plotted Units Sold over time to observe trends.
   - Relationship Analysis:
     - Used scatter plots to examine relationships between Units Sold, Unit Price, and Total Sales.
   - Correlation Analysis:
     - Generated a heatmap to study the correlation between numerical features.
   - Outlier Detection:
     - Used box plots and swarm plots to identify outliers in Total Sales.

3. Data Aggregation:
   - Grouped data by Product to calculate and visualize total sales for each product.

4. Advanced Visualizations:
   - Utilized pair plots to observe relationships across multiple numerical features.


Technologies Used:

- Libraries: 
  - pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
  - numpy for numerical computations.
  - matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
- Tools:
  - Python programming environment for implementing the analysis.
